At the age of 15, I moved from Nigeria to Canada in pursuit of better quality education. This was one of the most difficult but rewarding decisions I had to make with my family. I am a recent graduate from the University of Winnipeg who majored in Biochemistry and Mathematics. In my introductory and upper level course work, I have developed a strong passion for science specifically in the fields of biochemistry, molecular genetics, biomedical engineering (nanotechnology) and mathematical biology. This has made me extremely interested in pursuing exciting research and work opportunities in these fields. 

As a former international student, I have been exposed to a wide range of individuals and cultures. As a result, I have been able to rapidly adjust to changes and develop a wider perspective. I am always inteested in learning new things and enjoy troubleshooting and fixing problems. To sustain productivity, I am a detail-oriented person who keeps my objectives, tasks and goals structured. 

Outside of academics, I enjoy reading sci-fi books, hanging out with friends, trying new food and playing Monopoly competitively.

I believe that the skills I have gained from my dynamic environment and academic life characterize me, and I am looking forward to put them to use and refine them whenever the opprtunity arises.
