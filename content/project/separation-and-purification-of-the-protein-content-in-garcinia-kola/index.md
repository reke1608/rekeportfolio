title: Separation and Purification of the Protein Content in Garcinia kola
summary: Separated, purified, and characterized proteins from Garcinia kola seeds through sample preparation via slicing, oven-drying, grinding, defatting, and protein extraction using the urea/thiourea solubilization method, protein precipitation using the ammonium sulfate precipitation method, followed by SDS-PAGE analysis and Bradford Assay.

In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the demand for plant proteins as an alternative to animal proteins as plant proteins are becoming an appealing alternative in the hunt for new and sustainable protein sources. It is important that an efficient protein extraction method must be devised prior to any extraction and analysis of plant proteins. The objective of this study was to extract and purify the protein and polypeptide components in the seeds of Garcinia kola.

Protein extraction was successfully achieved via the urea/thiourea solubilization method. The molecular weight of the protein isolates was determined using SDS-PAGE. Protein extracts from the kernels of G. kola seeds revealed an 8-kDa polypeptide band. The 8-kDa polypeptide band might have come from non-specific lipid transfer proteins, which range in size from 7 to 9 kDa. No visible bands appeared on protein isolates from protein precipitation at 90% saturation. To determine the concentration of proteins, the Bradford Assay was used. The kernels of the seeds had an overall protein content of 0.0005%, expressed as a weight percentage of the final dry product. Overall, this research presents an effective approach for extracting proteins from G. kola seeds. Further research may wish to perform the protein extraction on a much larger scale to achieve more tangible and useful results and also perform comparative proteomic analysis on the protein isolates. Garcinia kola seed proteins can be investigated for their potential for additional applications, such as the production of bioactive peptides.
