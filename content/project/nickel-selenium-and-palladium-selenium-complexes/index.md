There is a growing interest in metal complexes with selenium ligands. Unfortunately, literature on nickel and palladium complexes with selenium ligands is very scanty. Hence, the aim of this research project was to report nickel-selenium and palladium-selenium complexes and add to the existing research on nickel and palladium complexes with selenium ligands. 

Our results are presented in a PDF file attached to this page.
