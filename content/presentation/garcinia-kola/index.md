abstract: In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the demand for plant proteins as an alternative to animal proteins as plant proteins are becoming an appealing alternative in the hunt for new and sustainable protein sources. It is important that an efficient protein extraction method must be devised prior to any extraction and analysis of plant proteins. The objective of this study was to extract and purify the protein and polypeptide components in the seeds of Garcinia kola.
