Misericordia Health Centre (MHC) has been providing excellent, compassionate care since 1898. Today MHC specializes in healthy aging, including Interim Care which provides a comfortable home-like environment for 145 Residents who are waiting to get into the personal care home of their choice. My volunteer role involved accompanying those wishing to attend Church services within the Centre and providing fresh ice water for residents room-to-room while taking time for social interaction with residents.
