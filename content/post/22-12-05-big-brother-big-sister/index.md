The future of a young person may suffer as a result of these difficulties. Young people's lives are changed via mentoring connections. Big Brothers Big Sisters mentors build strong, supportive connections with their mentees that express caring, challenge growth, share power, and widen possibilities with the help of professional training and support.

My role involved mentoring children and youth and helping them become better version of themselves. I also acted as a source of emotional and confidential support to youth and children in my care.
