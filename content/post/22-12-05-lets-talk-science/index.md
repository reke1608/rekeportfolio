Letâ€™s Talk Science is a registered Canadian charitable organization focused on education and skills development for children and youth in Canada through science, technology, engineering and math based programs. In order to provide a wide range of worthwhile science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) learning activities in both school and community settings, Let's Talk Science links educators and young people with exceptional volunteers. While volunteering with LTS, I organized and taught fun science experiments (usually hands on) to children and youth. At these schools, I usually discussed science and the opportunities available at the University of Winnipeg to help them develop there interest in science.
